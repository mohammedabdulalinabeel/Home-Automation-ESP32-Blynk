## 📱 Blynk Setup

- Platform: [https://blynk.cloud](https://blynk.cloud)
- Virtual Pins:
  - `V0`: Light Control
  - `V1`: Fan Control
- WiFi SSID (for Wokwi): `Wokwi-GUEST`
- No password needed

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **ESP32** connects to Wi-Fi and syncs with Blynk Cloud.
2. The **Blynk app** sends ON/OFF commands through virtual pins.
3. **Relay modules or LEDs** simulate the activation of **light and fan**.
4. Circuit and logic can also be tested in **Wokwi** using LEDs instead of actual hardware.

## 💻 Code Snippet

```cpp
#define lightPin 4
#define fanPin 5

void setup() {
  pinMode(lightPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(fanPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // Logic triggered via Blynk (use BLYNK_WRITE() in real deployment)
}
